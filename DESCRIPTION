Description: This package uses the data.tree package to create
  tries that use a modified form of the aho-corasick algorithm
  to allow finding and replacing large numbers of dictionary
  keys in a text. Really only makes sense when your dictionary
  is quite large (> 500 terms). Useful for things like entity
  resolution in texts. Should probably be reimplimented in 
  c++ to make it super fast...¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
